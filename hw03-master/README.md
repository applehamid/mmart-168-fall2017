1. Modifying InnerHTML

Update the modifyText function so that it:

Changes the text of message2 to be the message of the BeyonceTweet object
Changes the text of link2 to be the name from the BeyonceTweet object
Changes the text of user2 to be the handle from the BeyonceTweet object
Hint: If you're struggling to understand the HTML, try drawing a schema diagram like we did in class and in HW02 to get a better understanding of it. Make sure to turn this in with your assignment if you do the work! (:

2. Modifying Attributes: Part I

Update the changeLinkAndImageAttributes function so that it:

Sets the href attribute for link1 to point to the first element in the links array
Sets the href attribute for link2 to point to the second element in the links array
Sets the src attribute for the beyonce image to point to the third element in the links array
3. Modifying Attributes: Part II

Update the changeClassAttribute function so that it replaces the “tweet” class with the “tweet-pink” class for the two tweets.

4. Appending Elements

Update the appendElements function so that it adds the following elements to the bottom of tweet1:

An "a" element (a link) that links to our course website (https://f17.ebook.mmart.us/) and has a link text that say "Intro to JavaScript."
An "img" element (an image) that points to an image of your choice, symbolizing something about the course.
